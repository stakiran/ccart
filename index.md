## What is Conceptual Counter Art?
It is an art form that presents a new concept that serves as a counter to an existing concept.

There are two key points:

- **Connecting utility and art:** dealing with practical concepts  
- **Expressing the concept:** expressing it only through a linguistically simple name

There are also several patterns of “counter”:

- **Against A, ___:**
  - Present a concept that directly opposes A
  - Present a strengthened version of A
  - Present a new paradigm that replaces A
  - Treat A as an instance of class C, and present another instance B of C
  - ...

In any case, what they share is a stance of resistance against A. The essence of Conceptual Counter Art is to generate and present a new concept with the force to “kill” A.
